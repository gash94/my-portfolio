                        Hello World! Let me introduce myself as Pawe≈Ç Gasz, a
                        young and ambitious programmer who aspires to excel in
                        software development, especially in JavaScript. I
                        possess strong programming skills and continuously
                        strive for growth in this dynamic field.

                    <p>
                        My passion for IT started at an early age, and now as a
                        young aspiring programmer, I channel my energy and
                        enthusiasm towards creating innovative solutions using
                        JavaScript. This language not only serves as a tool for
                        my work but also inspires me to constantly improve in
                        building interactive and responsive websites and web
                        applications.

                    <p>
                        I have gained extensive experience working with
                        JavaScript, both in individual and team projects. My
                        skills encompass both front-end and back-end
                        development, including the utilization of frameworks
                        such as React and Node.js. My determination and
                        problem-solving abilities enable me to create software
                        that meets clients requirements and delivers value to
                        them.
