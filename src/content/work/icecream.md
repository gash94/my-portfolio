HTML5 is used to structure the content of the website, providing a semantic and organized layout. CSS3 and SASS are employed to style and design the visual elements, including colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. SASS, as a CSS preprocessor, enhances the development process by allowing the use of variables, mixins, and nesting, making the stylesheets more maintainable and efficient.

JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to the website. It is used to implement dynamic features such as image sliders, interactive menus, and form validation. JavaScript also enables the website to respond to user interactions, providing a more engaging user experience.

The project utilizes various development tools and technologies. npm (Node Package Manager) is used for managing and installing project dependencies, allowing for the integration of external libraries or frameworks. Parcel is a web application bundler that facilitates the process of bundling and optimizing the website's assets, ensuring faster load times. GitHub serves as a version control system, enabling collaboration among the team members and ensuring a centralized and organized codebase.

The website showcases the fictitious ice cream parlor's offerings, including various flavors, special promotions, and an online ordering system. It provides an appealing and user-friendly interface for customers to browse and select their desired ice cream flavors and place orders. The website's design, layout, and overall user experience reflect the collective efforts and leadership of the development team, with Paweł Gasz leading the project.
