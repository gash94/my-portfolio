The "EventBooster" application utilizes several technologies and tools that contribute to its functionality and appearance. SASS, a CSS preprocessor, is used for styling the user interface, enabling more efficient style management and providing many useful features.

For managing JavaScript dependencies and packages, the npm package manager is used. It allows for easy installation, updating, and removal of packages used in the application.

Communication with the server is done through a REST API, which provides an interface for retrieving event-related data. The Axios library is used to make HTTP requests to the API, providing a simple interface for creating requests and handling responses.

To build and deploy the application, the parcel bundler is utilized. Parcel is a fast, easy-to-use bundler that automatically handles dependency importation and builds in the application.

For source code hosting and collaboration with other developers, a code hosting platform like GitHub is used. GitHub allows for version control, project management, and team collaboration through features such as issue tracking and pull request system.

During the interface design phase of the application, a user interface design tool such as Figma can be utilized. Figma allows for prototyping, interaction design, and sharing of design projects with the team.

By combining these different technologies and tools, the "EventBooster" application provides users with an easy way to search and browse events in various countries. It serves as a practical tool for individuals who want to stay up to date with events of their interest worldwide.
