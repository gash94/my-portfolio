The website utilizes HTML5 for structuring the content and creating a semantically meaningful layout. CSS3 and SCSS are employed to style and design the elements of the website, including colors, fonts, margins, and backgrounds, to achieve an appealing visual appearance. SCSS, as a preprocessor for CSS, allows for the use of variables, mixins, and nesting, making the stylesheets more efficient and maintainable.

Responsive layout techniques have been implemented to ensure that the website adapts and displays correctly across different screen sizes and devices. This enables a seamless user experience regardless of the device being used to access the website.

The project incorporates ready-made JavaScript scripts, such as a hamburger menu, to enhance the interactivity and functionality of the website. These scripts enable the navigation menu to transform into a compact mobile-friendly version, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for mobile users.

It is important to note that this website is a fictitious example and does not represent an actual company. The project was created for educational or training purposes, showcasing coding and design skills in the realm of web development.
