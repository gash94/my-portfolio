    "WalletAPP" is a web application created using advanced web technologies. It is a finance management platform that allows users to track their expenses and incomes. The application is built in JavaScript using libraries such as React and Redux, enabling a dynamic and interactive UI. Communication with the server is done through a REST API using Axios, while data is stored in a MongoDB database. The application also utilizes Chart.js for generating charts, StyledComponents for easy style management, Formik for forms, and leverages express.js and node.js for server-side logic. Additionally, Swagger has been implemented to provide API documentation for users and developers.

"WalletAPP" is an advanced web application created in JavaScript that allows users to manage their expenses conveniently and efficiently. The application was developed using various technologies and tools, such as React, Redux, REST API, Axios, Chart.js, StyledComponents, Formik, express.js, node.js, MongoDB, swagger (docs), and JWT.

React is used as the main framework to build the user interface of the application, making it dynamic and responsive for smooth and fast data browsing and comfortable expense management.

Redux is employed for state management, enabling global data management and making the application scalable and easier to maintain. With Redux, data is stored in a centralized store and accessible to various components.

REST API and Axios are used for communication with the server and retrieving data related to user expenses. This allows the application to effectively read, add, edit, and delete expenses on the server.

Chart.js is utilized to generate charts and statistics regarding expenses. It provides visual data representation, helping users better understand and analyze their expenses.

StyledComponents are used for styling React components, resulting in a clean and consistent appearance, with styles managed at the component level.

Formik simplifies form handling in the application, leading to a more intuitive and enjoyable user experience when adding and editing expenses.

Express.js and node.js handle the backend of the application, ensuring efficient request handling, creating custom API endpoints, and managing data on the server.

MongoDB serves as the database to store user expense-related data. It is a scalable and flexible solution, allowing for effective data management.

Swagger (docs) enables API documentation generation, facilitating understanding and usage of available endpoints by other developers.

JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for user authentication and data security, ensuring the application can provide user privacy and security.
