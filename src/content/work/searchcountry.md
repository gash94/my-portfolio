HTML5 is used to structure the content and create the necessary elements for the user interface. CSS3 and SCSS are employed to style and design the visual appearance of the application, including the layout, colors, typography, and other design aspects. SCSS, as a CSS preprocessor, offers advanced features like variables, mixins, and nesting, which enhance the maintainability and organization of the stylesheets.

JavaScript is responsible for the interactivity and functionality of the application. It handles user input, triggers API requests to retrieve country data, and dynamically updates the information displayed on the page. JavaScript also facilitates the integration of illustrations of the flags and generates the links to the respective Wikipedia pages for each country.

The application utilizes an API or data source to fetch information about countries. With each search query, the application retrieves data such as the country's capital city, region, population size, and official language. It also displays illustrations of the flags, providing a visual representation of each country. Additionally, the application generates a link to the respective Wikipedia page, allowing users to access detailed information about the selected country.
